# Super-Resolution
In this repository I will implement SR papers using tensorflow 2.0

I have trained the SRCNN for 60000 epochs.

You can find the trained models and training logs in this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15BDCxku5RXoLUwUpvxT7f7do3lR453SG)

you can donwload the 91 dataset as well as Set5 and set14 in this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KTRWi8aIBSip0Ir7XvWjNg9eumhQan_R)
